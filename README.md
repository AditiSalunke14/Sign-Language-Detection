# Sign-Language-Detection
A real-time hand sign recognition system using OpenCV, CVZone, Mediapipe, and a trained Keras model.This aims to assist people with hearing or speech impairments by enabling smoother communication with non-signers.This project detects hand gestures via webcam and classifies them into predefined sign language
